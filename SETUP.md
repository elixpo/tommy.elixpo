# Setting Up Tommy

Tommy is a self-hosted Discord bot that connects your Discord server to a GitHub repository. It lets team members manage issues, review PRs, search code, and run project management — all from Discord.

This guide walks you through setup from scratch. No prior experience with bots required.

---

## What You Need Before Starting

- A computer or server that stays on (Tommy runs 24/7)
- Python 3.10 or newer installed
- A Discord account with permission to add bots to your server
- A GitHub account with access to the repo you want to connect

---

## Step 1 — Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tommy.git
cd tommy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Step 2 — Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"** and give it a name (e.g. "Tommy")
3. Go to the **Bot** tab on the left
4. Click **"Reset Token"** and copy the token — you'll need it soon
5. Scroll down to **"Privileged Gateway Intents"** and turn ON:
   - **Message Content Intent**
   - **Server Members Intent**
6. Go to the **OAuth2** tab → **URL Generator**
   - Under "Scopes", check `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - Under "Bot Permissions", check: `Send Messages`, `Read Messages/View Channels`, `Create Public Threads`, `Embed Links`, `Attach Files`, `Read Message History`, `Add Reactions`
7. Copy the generated URL, open it in your browser, and add the bot to your server

---

## Step 3 — Create a GitHub App

A GitHub App lets Tommy interact with your repo securely.

1. Go to [GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps)
2. Click **"New GitHub App"**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name**: anything (e.g. "tommy-bot")
   - **Homepage URL**: your repo URL
   - **Webhook**: uncheck "Active" (Tommy handles its own webhooks)
4. Under **Permissions → Repository**, set:
   - Contents: **Read & Write**
   - Issues: **Read & Write**
   - Pull Requests: **Read & Write**
   - Metadata: **Read**
5. Click **"Create GitHub App"**
6. On the next page, note the **App ID** number at the top
7. Scroll down and click **"Generate a private key"** — save the `.pem` file into your tommy folder as `tommy.pem`
8. Click **"Install App"** in the left sidebar → select your repo → **Install**
9. After installing, look at the URL — it will be like `https://github.com/settings/installations/12345`. The number at the end is your **Installation ID**.

---

## Step 4 — Set Up Your Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` in a text editor and fill in:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=paste-your-discord-bot-token
GITHUB_APP_ID=your-app-id-number
GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY=./tommy.pem
GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID=your-installation-id
POLLINATIONS_TOKEN=                          # leave blank for free Pollinations AI
```

The `.env.example` file has detailed comments explaining how to get each key.

---

## Step 5 — Configure the Bot

Open `config.json` and update these fields:

```jsonc
{
  "bot": {
    "name": "Tommy",                         // your bot's display name
    "default_repo": "your-org/your-repo"     // the repo Tommy will work with
  },
  "github": {
    "admin_users": ["your-github-username"],  // who can use admin commands
    "whitelisted_repos": ["your-org/your-repo"]
  },
  "discord": {
    "admin_role_ids": []                      // Discord role IDs that count as admin
                                              // (right-click a role → Copy ID)
  }
}
```

Everything else has sensible defaults. See the comments in `config.json` for all options.

## Step 6 — Add Your Project Knowledge (Optional)

Open `src/context/repo_info.txt` and write a short description of your project. This is background knowledge the bot uses in every conversation — think of it as a cheat sheet you'd give a new team member. Things like:

- What your project does
- Key API endpoints or services
- Important links (docs, dashboards)
- Terminology or concepts unique to your project

---

## Step 7 — Run the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see:

```
Starting Tommy Bot...
Bot: Tommy
Default repo: your-org/your-repo
GitHub auth: App
```

Mention the bot in Discord (`@Tommy help`) to verify it's working.

---

## Step 8 — Set Up CI Pipelines (Optional)

Tommy comes with GitHub Actions workflows that respond to mentions in issues/PRs, auto-assign PR authors, and manage project boards.

### Add GitHub Secrets

Go to your repo → **Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `TOMMY_BOT_APP_ID` | Your GitHub App ID (same as `.env`) |
| `TOMMY_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Contents of your `.pem` file (paste the full text) |
| `PLN_GITHUB_TOMMY_KEY` | Your AI provider token (same as `POLLINATIONS_TOKEN`) |

> The secret names are configurable in `.github/tommy.yml` → `github.secrets`.

### Configure the CI

Open `.github/tommy.yml` and review the settings. The key ones:

- `bot.trigger_phrase` — the word that activates the bot in GitHub issues/PRs (default: `tommy`)
- `github.secrets` — must match the secret names you just added
- `ai.models` — which AI models the CI workflows use

The workflows will now respond when someone writes "tommy" in an issue or PR comment.

---

## Running in the Background

For production, use a process manager so the bot stays running:

```bash
# Using systemd (Linux)
# Create /etc/systemd/system/tommy.service, then:
sudo systemctl enable tommy
sudo systemctl start tommy

# Or simply using screen/tmux:
screen -S tommy
python main.py
# Ctrl+A, D to detach
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| "Invalid Discord token" | Double-check `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env`. Reset the token in the Discord Developer Portal if needed. |
| "Privileged Intents Required" | Enable Message Content Intent in Discord Developer Portal → Bot tab. |
| Bot doesn't respond | Make sure the bot has permission to read/send messages in the channel. Check that it's actually online in the server member list. |
| GitHub commands fail | Verify your GitHub App is installed on the correct repo and has the right permissions. |
| Embeddings fail | Check `EMBEDDINGS_API_KEY` in `.env` if using `"provider": "api"`. For local models, make sure the model downloads successfully. |
